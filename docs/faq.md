# FAQ

## Why run my project in the cloud?

**Collaboration**:

- Share the output of your work with others
- Consume pipeline outputs in other services
- Work on multiple parts of a pipeline with confidence

**Reproducibility**:

- So you never have to say 'works on my machine' again
- Catch breaking changes across your whole pipeline
- Get rapid feedback as your project progresses

**Automation**:

- The cloud is better than your laptop for long or critical tasks
- Get notifications via messages and develop asynchronously
- Peace of mind as breaking changes are caught automatically
