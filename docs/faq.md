# FAQ

## Why run my project in the cloud?

1. **Collaboration**: To share the output of your work with others
2. **Reproducibility**: So you never have to say 'works on my machine' again
3. **Automation**: The cloud is better than your laptop for long or critical tasks

## How much does Treebeard cost?

Treebeard is free to use and most of it is open source (we're working on opening up the rest). View the code at [https://github.com/treebeardtech/treebeard](https://github.com/treebeardtech/treebeard)

## How do you make money if Treebeard is free?

Whilst we have free basic infrastructure available for running small projects, adding paid services may help companies get the most out of Treebeard in future. There will always be a free version available to the open source community.

## What does Treebeard do with my data?

The Treebeard library relies on our backend services for executing yoru project, serving your outputs, and integrating with your Github and Slack accounts if requested.
