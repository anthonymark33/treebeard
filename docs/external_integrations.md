# Github and Slack integrations

Ensure you have setup your account first using `treebeard configure`

## Github

You can install our [Github App](https://github.com/marketplace/treebeard-build) to automatically build your project when you push to Github.

Treebeard will set your commit status depenending on the output of your build, and you can use this to prevent merging to master from a broken branch.

## Slack

Slack users can enable notifications for results. Install this from the settings menu in the web page when viewing your build.

You will then be prompted to select a channel and will receive a notification to confirm setup.

## Disintegrating

Both Github and Slack integrations can be removed via your Slack workspace and Github account settings.
