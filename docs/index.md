# ðŸŒ² Welcome to Treebeard

Treebeard is a library which reproduces Python data science work in the cloud, natively supporting Jupyter Notebooks.

Treebeard allows you to do the following without bash scripts:

- Schedule notebooks in the cloud, working with all types of dependencies
- Setup continuous integration for your Github repo, to test notebooks on each push
- Fetch outputs from each cloud run using versioned URLs

The goal is to allow data scientists to set up continuous integration with minimal changes to their project.

Treebeard works by adding the `treebeard` pip package to your `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`, or `environment.yml`.

Then placing a `treebeard.yaml` file in the same directory like so:

```yaml
# treebeard.yaml
notebooks:
  - run.ipynb
ignore:
  - venv
```

then running `treebeard run`.

We host back-end infrastructure for running your notebook in the cloud, and serving output data.

## Install Treebeard

Treebeard is available via pip. Please note only Python 3.6 or higher is supported.

```bash
âžœ pip --version
pip 20.0.2 from /Users/.../python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)
```

```bash
âžœ pip install -e ./treebeard-lib
```

## Get started

Authenticate your CLI with our backend infrastructure using your email address.

```bash
âžœ treebeard configure --email test@example.com
ðŸ”‘  Config saved in /Users/project_user/.treebeard
```

You will then need to verify your email address.

Clone our git repo to try the examples

```bash
âžœ git clone https://github.com/treebeardtech/treebeard.git
```

### Running your first example

```bash
âžœ cd treebeard/examples/hello_treebeard
âžœ jupyter notebook
...

âžœ treebeard run --daily
â ™ ðŸŒ²  Compressing repo
  Including main.ipynb
  Including requirements.txt
  Including treebeard.yaml
âœ¨  Run has been accepted! https://treebeard.io/admin/b44c784b10/treebeard_example_2/cf7a1475-6105-42b6-abeb-ba71420c6a55

# get the latest outputs

# what's my API key?
âžœ cat ~/.treebeard
[credentials]
treebeard_email = laurence@treebeard.io
treebeard_project_id = xxxxxx
treebeard_api_key = xxxxxxxxx

âžœ curl -o my_data.json \
https://api.treebeard.io/b44c784b10/treebeard_example_2/cli-latest/output/my_data.json?api_key=xxxxxxxxxx
{"mydata": "goes_here"}
```

The entry example shows the basic capabilities of the cloud build service.  
The notebook uses some cloud credentials to call an API, saves an image to an output directory, and calls a separate python script.

We recommend working in a python virtual environment. Ensure your python (3.6 or higher) environment has jupyter and treebeard installed, and then start jupyter in the project directory:
`jupyter notebook`

Open `main.ipynb` and check out the examples. When you're ready, return to the command line and instruct treebeard to build the project on the cloud with:
`treebeard run`

### Examples

There are several example projects in the `examples` folder.

The `reddit_tracker` example shows a notebook that calls the Reddit API using saved credentials, extracts the most commonly mentioned names from recent submissions and saves charts showing those common names. This is then run daily, and the images can then be served through a browser extension. [This blog]("https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-track-sentiment-on-reddit-with-python-and-a-chrome-extension-a623d63e3a1d?gi=90de4fb3934a") goes into more detail.
