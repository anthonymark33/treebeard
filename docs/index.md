# ðŸŒ² Welcome to Treebeard

Treebeard is an open source library which reproduces Python data science work in the cloud, natively supporting Jupyter Notebooks.

The goal is to allow data scientists to set up continuous integration with minimal changes to their project.

Treebeard works by adding a config file in the same directory as your `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`, or `environment.yml` like so:

```yaml
# treebeard.yaml
notebook: run.ipynb
ignore:
  - venv
```

then running `treebeard run`.

We host back-end infrastructure for running your notebook in the cloud, and serving output data.
