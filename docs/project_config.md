# Configuring your project

Note: Whichever form of dependency management you use, you will need to include `treebeard` as a dependency.

Treebeard requires the directory which it is run in to contain:

1. Some type of dependencies file (requirements.txt, Pipfile, or environment.yml)
2. A treebeard.yaml file

An example of a valid project directory is shown below.

Note that it contains a `venv` which we do not want to upload to Treebeard, and a `.env` file containing credentials used by this project.

```

```yaml
# treebeard.yaml

ignore:
  - venv
  - .vscode
  - .ipynb_checkpoints
  - "*pyc"
secret:
  - .env
output_dirs:
  - my_output
  - another_output
```

## treebeard.yaml fields

_**notebook**_ (default: _main.ipynb_)
<br/>
must point to an ipynb file existing somewhere in the project

_**ignore**_ (default: _[]_)
<br/>
lists files which will are not to be uploaded to treebeard. They will not be available at runtime

_**secret**_ (default: _[]_)
<br/>
lists files which can be stored in Treebeard using `treebeard secrets push` and will then be available at runtime. This may be necessary for Github integration

_**output_dirs**_ (default: _['output']_)
<br/>
list directories where outputs are saved. Outputs will be served via a versioned API by Treebeard

Depending on your use case, you can use a minimal config file e.g.

```yaml
# treebeard.yaml
notebook: run.ipynb
```

## Advanced: Repo2Docker Configuration

Treebeard is built on top of repo2docker, a great open source project which determines how to install your dependencies. If you need custom packages (usually installed via `apt-get install ...` ) then you can supply the config files such as _apt.txt_ which they accept and are listed in their [docs](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html).
