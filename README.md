# Welcome to Treebeard ðŸŒ²

Treebeard is a library which reproduces Python data science work in the cloud, natively supporting Jupyter Notebooks.

Treebeard allows you to do the following without bash scripts:

- Schedule notebooks in the cloud, working with all types of dependencies
- Setup continuous integration for your Github repo, to test notebooks on each push
- Fetch outputs from each cloud run using versioned URLs

The goal is to allow data scientists to set up continuous integration with minimal changes to their project.
