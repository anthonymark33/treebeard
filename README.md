# Welcome to Treebeard ðŸŒ²

Treebeard is a library which reproduces Python data science work in the cloud, natively supporting Jupyter Notebooks.

The goal is to allow data scientists to set up continuous integration with minimal changes to their project.

Read the [docs](https://treebeard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to get started.

## Integration with Managed Services

We want this library to be useful with existing services so it hooks into our minimal backend which runs the notebooks and talks to Slack and Github free of charge.

Our docs describe how to check your repository for errors and produce notebook outputs when you push.

Slack users can choose to be notified upon completion.
